# Hoo's Menu
Hoo's ever been in this situation: you're wondering where to eat, so you open up multiple UVA dining tabs to try to compare what's being served at each dining hall. But the 30+ some seconds it takes to navigate the mess of slow-loading pages exhausts your 5 second attention span, so you give up and decide to just go to O'Hill for the 127th time in a row.

Hoo knows how many times _we've_ been in that position!! That's why we've created Hoo's Menu, the premier way to browse today's menus today!

All you need to do is:
1. navigate to Hoo's Menu
2. read Hoo's Menu

It's that easy!
